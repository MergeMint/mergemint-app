    "faq1Question": "What counts as an \"active developer\"?",
    "faq1Answer": "An active developer is anyone who has had at least one PR evaluated in the current billing period. Developers who don't contribute don't count toward your limit.",
    "faq2Question": "Can I switch between plans?",
    "faq2Answer": "Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade at any time. When upgrading, you'll be charged a prorated amount. When downgrading, the new rate applies at your next billing cycle.",
    "faq3Question": "Do I need my own Anthropic API key?",
    "faq3Answer": "For self-hosted installations, yes—you'll need to provide your own API key for Claude. The hosted Pro plan includes AI credits.",
    "faq4Question": "Is my code sent to the AI?",
    "faq4Answer": "Yes, PR diffs are sent to Claude for evaluation. If this is a concern, you can self-host and use your own API key with enterprise-grade data handling agreements.",
    "faq5Question": "What happens if I exceed my developer limit?",
    "faq5Answer": "We'll notify you when you're approaching your limit. New PRs will still be processed, but we'll ask you to upgrade to continue.",

    "cat1Title": "Getting Started",
    "cat1Q1": "What is MergeMint?",
    "cat1A1": "MergeMint is an open-source platform that uses AI to automatically evaluate and score pull requests. It helps engineering teams run bug bounty programs, recognize top contributors, and measure developer impact objectively.",
    "cat1Q2": "How does MergeMint evaluate PRs?",
    "cat1A2": "When a PR is merged, MergeMint fetches the diff and sends it to Claude (Anthropic's AI). The AI analyzes the changes, classifies the affected component and severity level, checks eligibility criteria (issue linked, tests, documentation), and calculates a score using your configured multipliers.",
    "cat1Q3": "How long does it take to set up?",
    "cat1A3": "Most teams are up and running in under 5 minutes. You install the GitHub App, select which repositories to track, and configure your scoring rules. MergeMint starts processing new PRs immediately.",
    "cat1Q4": "Can I process historical PRs?",
    "cat1A4": "Yes! MergeMint includes a backfill feature that lets you process PRs from before you installed the app. This is great for establishing baseline scores and historical leaderboards.",
    "cat2Title": "Scoring & Configuration",
    "cat2Q1": "How is the final score calculated?",
    "cat2A1": "The formula is: Final Score = Base Points (from severity) × Multiplier (from component). For example, a P1 severity fix (50 base points) in the Auth component (1.5× multiplier) would earn 75 points.",
    "cat2Q2": "What are eligibility criteria?",
    "cat2A2": "MergeMint checks four criteria: (1) Is this fixing an issue/bug? (2) Does the implementation actually fix what it claims? (3) Is the PR properly documented? (4) Are tests included? PRs that fail eligibility still get evaluated but score 0 points.",
    "cat2Q3": "Can I customize the components and multipliers?",
    "cat2A3": "Absolutely! You define your own components (e.g., Auth, Payments, UI) and assign multipliers based on complexity or business importance. You can also set up file path rules to auto-classify PRs.",
    "cat2Q4": "How accurate is the AI classification?",
    "cat2A4": "In our testing, Claude correctly classifies component and severity ~90% of the time. You can review and override any evaluation if needed. The AI provides justification for its decisions to help you understand its reasoning.",
    "cat3Title": "GitHub Integration",
    "cat3Q1": "What GitHub permissions does MergeMint need?",
    "cat3A1": "MergeMint needs read access to code and pull requests (to analyze diffs), and write access to issues (to post evaluation comments). We only access repositories you explicitly enable.",
    "cat3Q2": "Does MergeMint work with GitHub Enterprise?",
    "cat3A2": "Yes, MergeMint supports GitHub Enterprise Server. For self-hosted installations, you'll need to configure the GitHub App with your enterprise domain.",
    "cat3Q3": "Can I disable the PR comments?",
    "cat3A3": "Yes, PR comments are optional. You can disable them globally or per-repository while still collecting scores in the dashboard.",
    "cat3Q4": "Does MergeMint support GitLab or Bitbucket?",
    "cat3A4": "Currently, MergeMint only supports GitHub. GitLab support is on our roadmap. Bitbucket support depends on community interest.",
    "cat4Title": "Privacy & Security",
    "cat4Q1": "Is my code sent to the AI?",
    "cat4A1": "Yes, PR diffs are sent to Claude (Anthropic) for evaluation. If this is a concern, you can self-host MergeMint and use your own Anthropic API key with enterprise-grade data handling agreements.",
    "cat4Q2": "Can I self-host MergeMint?",
    "cat4A2": "Yes! MergeMint is open source under CC BY-NC 4.0. You can deploy it on your own infrastructure for non-commercial use. For commercial use, please contact us for licensing options.",
    "cat4Q3": "What data does MergeMint store?",
    "cat4A3": "MergeMint stores PR metadata (title, author, file list, diff snippets), evaluation results (scores, classifications), and aggregated statistics. We don't store your full codebase.",
    "cat4Q4": "Is MergeMint SOC 2 compliant?",
    "cat4A4": "The hosted version is SOC 2 Type II compliant. For self-hosted deployments, compliance depends on your infrastructure. We provide security best practices documentation.",
    "cat5Title": "Pricing & Plans",
    "cat5Q1": "Is MergeMint free?",
    "cat5A1": "MergeMint is free for non-commercial use under CC BY-NC 4.0. Self-host it for personal projects, education, or open source. For commercial use, contact us for licensing.",
    "cat5Q2": "Is there a free tier for the hosted version?",
    "cat5A2": "We offer a 14-day free trial of Pro, and the hosted version is completely free for open source projects. Contact us to apply for the OSS program.",
    "cat5Q3": "Do I need my own Anthropic API key?",
    "cat5A3": "For self-hosted installations, yes—you'll need to provide your own Anthropic API key. The hosted Pro plan includes AI credits.",
